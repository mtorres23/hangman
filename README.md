Hang Man Project

Overview

For project one, I have created a simple game called Hang Man.

Upon coming to my site, towards the bottom middle of the page, you will notice you basic game setup. Your word input will go directly above the "hints" button on the designated line. Upon starting a new game, you will notice underneath, a list of alphabet letters. Each time you choose a letter, it will either fill in the correct letter or take away a guess. You will be given an opportunity of nine tries to complete the game. If you do not succeed in guessing the correct letters or word, you will lose the game and be prompted, “Better luck next time”.
