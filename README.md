Hang Man Project

Overview

For project one, I have created a simple game called Hang Man.

Upon coming to my site, towards the bottom middle of the page, you will be prompted to start a new game. Your word input will go directly above the new game button on the designated dotted lines. Upon starting a new game, you will notice to the right, a list of alphabet letters. Each time you choose a letter, it fill fade out of the box. You will be given an opportunity of six tries to complete the game. If you do not succeed in guessing the correct letters or word, you will lose the game and be prompted, “Better luck next time”.
